    "`napari` is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It’s designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It’s built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).\n",
    "\n",
    "`napari` includes critical viewer features out-of-the-box, such as support for large multi-dimensional data, layering, and annotation. By integrating closely with the scientific Python ecosystem, napari can be easily coupled to leading machine learning and image analysis tools (e.g. scikit-image, scikit-learn, PyTorch), enabling more user-friendly automated analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "`napari` supports seven different layer types, **Image**, **Labels**, **Points**, **Vectors**, **Shapes**, **Surface** and **Tracks**. Each layer corresponds to a different data type and has it's own set of visualizations and interactive controls. We provide an [associated tutorial](https://napari.org/tutorials/index.html) for each layer type to help you get started! \n",
    "\n",
    "You can add multiple layers of different types into the viewer and work with them, adjusting their properties and performing analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "`napari` also supports bidirectional communication between the viewer and the Python kernel, which is especially useful when launching from jupyter notebooks or when using our built-in console. Using the console allows you to interactively load and save data from the viewer and control all the features of the viewer programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can (and are encouraged to!) extend `napari` using custom [key bindings](https://napari.org/guides/stable/connecting_events.html#listening-for-keypress-events), [mouse functions](https://napari.org/guides/stable/connecting_events.html#listening-for-mouse-events), and our new [**plugin-interface**](https://napari.org/plugins/stable/for_plugin_developers.html).\n",
