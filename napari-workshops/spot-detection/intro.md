# Spot detection workshop

This workshop will take you through the basics of bioimage analysis in Python and [napari](https://www.napari.org).
We will be performing spot detection using a combination of `napari`, `scikit-image`, and `scipy`.

## Instructors
The two instructors for this workshop are
- Kevin Yamauchi ([@ky396](https://twitter.com/ky396))
- Alister Burt ([@AlisterBurt](https://twitter.com/AlisterBurt))

## Goals
The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to bioimage analysis in Python and `napari`. By the end of the workshop you should be able to
- use napari as an image viewer
- perform interactive analysis with napari in a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- make use of the [napari plugin ecosystem](https://www.napari-hub.org/)
